Knapsack with Duplicate Items 
Easy Accuracy: 53.4% Submissions: 21682 Points: 2
Given a set of N items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array w[] and val[] respectively. Also, a knapsack with weight limit W.
The task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit.
Note: Each item can be taken any number of times.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 2, W = 3
val[] = {1, 1}
wt[] = {2, 1}
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1.Pick the 2nd element thrice.
2.Total profit = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Also the total 
  weight = 1 + 1 + 1  = 3 which is <= W.
 

Example 2:

Input: N = 4, W = 8
val[] = {1, 4, 5, 7}
wt[] = {1, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 11
Explanation: The optimal choice is to 
pick the 2nd and 4th element.
 

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function knapSack() which takes the values N, W and the arrays val[] and wt[] as input parameters and returns the maximum possible value.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*W)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(W)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ N, W ≤ 1000
1 ≤ val[i], wt[i] ≤ 100
